# Project Bonsai Experimentation

You can find a summarized article describing the spikes and brains trained with Bonsai [here](https://medium.com/southworks/project-bonsai-our-first-look-at-it-39b62f869058).

Our learning path, simulator code and learning definitions within the repo leverages our experience playing with an emergent technology from Microsoft called Project Bonsai - an artificial intelligence platform currently in preview state. It allows solving machine learning problems using deep reinforcement learning without requiring an extensive machine learning background.

This tool relies on people's expertise to break a problem into easier tasks and give machine learning models important clues about how to find a solution faster - a concept that is called machine teaching, a new programming paradigm that expresses the solution to a problem in terms of how you teach the computer to find the solution as opposed to how to calculate it.
