# Conclusions
Bonsai is a tool with many interesting powerful features and has a lot of potential.

The fact that it does not demand a lot of machine learning knowledge from the user could make it a very interesting platform to work with for developers without an artificial intelligence background.

If the user does have a bit of experience with machine learning, he is able to tune some settings more granularly - such as manually selecting the algorithm used for the agents. He is also able to use rewards and terminal functions directly instead of goals, which requires a bit more expertise but also gives the user more control that can lead to better results. However, not everything can be controlled directly by the user - for instance, the tuning of algorithm hyperparameters is done automatically by Bonsai and cannot be overridden.

As it is today, the platform is especially useful for final users that do not have an extensive machine learning background and just want to create and train models to solve specific problems without worrying too much about the internal algorithm details. Let's hope that more extensibility and fine tuning will be allowed in the future.
